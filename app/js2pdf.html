  The Basics
  Simply include the jsPDF library in your <head>, generate your PDF using the many built-in functions,
  then hook up a button to trigger the download. All the examples here use jQuery.
  Browser Compatibility
  jsPDF will work in IE6+*, Firefox 3+, Chrome, Safari 3+, Opera. For IE9 and below, we lazily load a
  Flash shim called Downloadify which enables the files to be downloaded.
  * Current build does not have IE6-9 shim enabled
  NB: UTF-8 is not supported by default, however there might be some plugins allowing you to use it,
  such as addHTML
